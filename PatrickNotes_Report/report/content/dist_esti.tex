\chapter{CT like controller with disturbance estimator}
Similar to the classical joint controller is this a decoupled control law. This means, every joint can be controlled separately. This is an advantage, as every joint can be controlled by a separate processing unit and does not need the information of the other joints. To weaken the effects of the nonlinearities, which were completely neglected in the classical joint control approach, a disturbance estimator is included in this controller. The control law consists of the average moment of inertia of the corresponding joint, a PD controller for the stabilisation and the disturbance estimator to compensate the unknown or unmodelled dynamics. The control law for the $i^{th}$ joint has the following form:
\begin{gather*}
	\tau_{c,i} = \bar{M}_{ii}\ddot{q}_{calc,i}+ \hat{w}_i(q_i,\dot{q}_i)
	\intertext{where:}
	\begin{tabular}{>{$}l<{$} @{${}:{}$} l}
		\bar{M}_{ii}             & average moment of inertia of the joint         \\
		\ddot{q}_{calc,i}        & $\ddot{q}_{D,i} + k_{d,i}\dot{e}_i+k_{p,i}e_i$ \\
		\hat{w}_i(q_i,\dot{q}_i) & estimated disturbances
	\end{tabular}\nonumber
\end{gather*}
For the estimation of the disturbances, a PI estimator of the following form is used:
\begin{gather*}
\hat{w}_i(q_i,\dot{q}_i) = l_i(\dot{q}_{calc,i} - \dot{q}_i)
\label{eq:eq1}
\intertext{where:}
\begin{tabular}{>{$}l<{$} @{${}:{}$} l}
l_i & estimator parameter
\end{tabular}\nonumber
\end{gather*}
Figure \ref{fig:ch5_structure} shows the block diagram of the controller structure for the $i^{th}$ joint.

When applying this controller,the error dynamics contain two frequencies. The first frequency is $\omega_n$ which is defined by the PD controller. The second frequency $\omega_{estim}$ is defined as $\frac{l_i}{\bar{M}_{ii}}$. Through the controller parameter $l_i$, this frequency can be set to different values. The peak position error depends on the ratio between the two frequencies.\\
To analyse the influence of the controller parameters, three simulations using different parameters were realised. In Table \ref{tab:ch5_distesti}, the applied values for the three controller are summarised.

Figure \ref{fig:ch5_sim1} shows the simulation results for $l_1 = l_2 = 20$ and a ratio of 2. The position error of the first joint does not exceed a maximum value of $0.02\,\mathrm{rad}$ but takes approximately $20\,\mathrm{s}$ to settle. For the second joint, the error settles much faster, at approximately $5\,\mathrm{s}$. The applied torque has a high initial peak and oscillates afterwards in the range of $24\,\mathrm{N\,m}$ and $35\,\mathrm{N\,m}$ for the first joint and from $7.5\,\mathrm{N\,m}$ up to $12\,\mathrm{N\,m}$ for the second joint.

Figure \ref{fig:ch5_sim2} shows the results of the simulation with $l_1 = l_2 = 100$ and a ratio of 2. Compared to the previous simulation, the system settles much faster. The first joint takes approximately $2\,\mathrm{s}$ to settle and the second is already settled after $1\,\mathrm{s}$. Also, the oscillation of the error has a lower amplitude than before. On the other hand, the initial torque peak is higher, with a value of approximately $200\,\mathrm{N\,m}$.\\
In Figure \ref{fig:ch5_sim3}, the simulation results with the controller parameters $l_1 = l_2 = 100$ and $\frac{\omega_{estim}}{\omega_n} = 10$ can be seen. Through the higher ratio, the frequency of the controller is reduced, which causes a higher settling time as in the previous simulation. The peak error is still much lower than in the first simulation with $l_i = 20$. The amplitude of the oscillation of the error is similar to the previous results. Increasing the ratio resulted in a lower torque peak at the beginning, which is now around $100\,\mathrm{N\,m}$.

In this chapter, a \ac{CT} like controller with PI disturbance estimator was shown and its efficiency was analysed. The behaviour of the controller depends mainly on the estimator parameter $l_i$ and the ratio between the frequencies $\frac{\omega_{estim}}{\omega_n}$. Increasing the parameter $l_i$ results in a faster settling of the error system. Changing the ratio $\frac{\omega_{estim}}{\omega_n}$ results in a change of the maximum position error and also influences the settling time.\\
The next chapter describes the design and the simulation of a sliding mode controller for the 2 \ac{DOF} planar robot.
